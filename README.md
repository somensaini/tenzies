## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

This project was created for the purpose of developing my React knowledge and skills. 

## Optimizations / Improvements:

~~Add dice faces on the dice instead of plain numbers.~~

~~Track the number of rolls.~~

~~Track the time it took to win.~~

~~Save the best time locally.~~

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first project after learning the basics of React. I learned how to effectively create components and use the State and Effect hooks in React. Creating this project has taught me the importance of React in modern web applications and has improved my ability to notice these components on modern sites and applications.

## Quick Start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
