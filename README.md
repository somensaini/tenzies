## Description:

Tenzies is a dice game developed using a seamless blend of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. This digital rendition of the classic game requires you to match all the dice to one number. When a die is clicked, it will be 'held' in place. Clicking 'Roll' will re-roll the non-held dice. Once all 10 dice are held and have the matching number, you win!

**Tech Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.

## Optimizations / Improvements:

~~Add dice faces on the dice instead of plain numbers.~~

~~Track the number of rolls.~~

~~Track the time it took to win.~~

~~Save the best time locally.~~

## Lessons Learned:

This is a React application used to further develop my React skills. I learned how to effectively create components and use the State and Effect hooks in React. Creating this application has taught me the importance of React in modern web applications and has improved my ability to notice these components on modern sites and applications.
